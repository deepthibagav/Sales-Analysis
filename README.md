# Practice-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
This is my first Data Analysis project, where I have applied and demonstrated a variety of visual features that I learned in Power BI. Throughout this project, I explored different data visualization techniques to effectively present and analyze the data. By utilizing Power BI's capabilities, I was able to create interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs that provide insightful and comprehensive views of the data. This project not only highlights my understanding of Power BI but also showcases my ability to leverage its tools to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
